You’ve reached the personal website of Dylan Herts.

I'm a lawyer. I’m interested in antitrust law, complex litigation, and computers. 

In my free time, I like to run, hike, listen to jazz, tinker with computers, and eat ice cream.

I occasionally blog here, mostly about ice cream. All opinions expressed on this site are mine and mine alone. Nothing here is legal advice.
