You’ve reached the personal website of Dylan Herts.

I'm a lawyer. Mainly, I practice civil litigation. I’m particularly interested in antitrust law, conflicts of law, and the finance and technology industries. 

In my free time, I like to run, hike, listen to jazz, tinker with computers, and eat ice cream.

I occasionally blog on this site, mostly about ice cream. 

All opinions expressed here are mine and mine alone. Nothing here is legal advice.
