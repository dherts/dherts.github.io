This is the personal website of Dylan Herts.

I'm an antitrust lawyer.

In my free time, I like to run, hike, tinker with computers, listen to jazz, and eat ice cream.

There are some old blog posts on here about ice cream, which I now write about on Mastodon.

All opinions expressed here are mine and mine alone. Nothing here is legal advice.
