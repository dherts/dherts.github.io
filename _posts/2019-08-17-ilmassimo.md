title: Il Massimo del Gelato - August 17, 2019
categories: icecream

At the end of our honeymoon, my wife and I had one final day in Milan. The city had emptied out for the summer, and most businesses were closed. She loves gelato, especially chocolate, and so given the shortage of activities, she looked for Milan's best. She found Il Massimo. Thankfully, it was open.

## What I Tasted

Il Massimo is known for its various flavors of chocolate. I counted at least seven. We tried as many as we could: 70% dark chocolate, spicy chocolate, chocolate with cherry, with rum, and with orange and Grand Marnier.

The 70% dark and the orange and Grand Marnier were the best. The rum flavor was strangely watery, and the spicy chocolate flavor was too hot, even for me.

## What I Ordered

Hooked by a sample, I chose the 70% dark chocolate. And while I rarely spring for a second flavor, I added pistachio, which is my first-choice among gelato flavors. The 70% dark chocolate stood up to further scrutiny: rich and smooth, it was probably the best chocolate gelato I've ever had. The pistachio was excellent, too, but not quite as good. Both melted slowly as we sat on the curb of a quiet Milanese side-street and watched a cab driver run in for a cone--a further sign that we were in the right spot.
