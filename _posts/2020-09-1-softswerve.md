I craved soft serve. So I stopped in at Soft Swerve, an Instagram-approved destination in Kip's Bay.  

### *What I Tasted*
Samples feel like a novelty now. They let me taste a bit of the Ube, which I ordered.

### *What I Ordered*
The swirl of ube and coconut underwhelmed me. It was sweet and creamy, to be sure. And it had the light, smooth texture of soft serve. But other than a hint of ube flavor, which I honestly can't describe too well, there wasn't that much else there.

I'll admit the standards are different for soft serve. It rarely comes in novel flavors. Even when it does, they lack the same depth as hard ice cream. (The only exception to this rule is the maple creemee). Soft serve's appeal is in its texture--the light, airy swirls--and its moment. You don't search out soft serve in the depths of winter. No, it's the stuff of beach-side stands, post-swim snacks, and sunny summer afternoons.

But even under those standards, Soft Swerve came up short. If I wanted a cup of sweet, cold creaminess with no strong flavor--and sometimes I do--there are cheaper, more widely available alternatives. And I rarely complain about this, but Soft Swerve didn't give me much ice cream. Part of the joy of soft serve is the quantity! You get to spoon your way down a tall peak of airy, swirled, pillowy sweetness! But not here.

### *The Shop*
Don't bother. If you want soft serve, seek out Mister Softee or Shake Shack. If you want novel flavors, hit Sundaes & Cones or Il Laboratorio.  This place promises both, but it doesn't deliver.
