It was a warm winter Saturday, and morning rain had given way to sunshine.  I took that as an excuse to revisit Van Leeuwen, which had advertised a monthly special flavor that had sounded good.

### *What I Tasted:*
No tastes.  What do you want?  It's still a pandemic.

### *What I Ordered:*
Buttermilk corn cake wildberry jam doesn't sound like a winter flavor.  Buttermilk doesn't really have any seasonal connotations.  And if corn cake does, I would think it's of summer or fall.   Wildberry jam is summery, too.  Seasonal confusion aside, I wanted to try it, as a [similar-sounding flavor](https://dylan.herts.io/2020/07/19/vanleeuwen.html) had been delightful.

The ice cream base was about right:  tangy and rich.  But there was too much corn cake.  It felt like it made up nearly half my scoop.  Plus, the cake was dry, which may have been due to the fact that it was gluten-free, too.  (Although for personal reasons, I was grateful for that.)  I would have gladly traded much of the cake for more of the tart, chewy wildberry jam.  Altogether, this flavor was pretty good, but it didn't live up to currants and cream.

### *The Shop*
Van Leeuwen remains an NYC staple in my book.  This flavor was decent, and it showed some creativity.  Its main shortcoming--the amount of cake--may well have been only true for my one scoop.  I'm looking forward to see what their March flavors bring--hopefully something a little more like spring.
