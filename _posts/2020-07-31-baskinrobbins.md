title: "Baskin Robbins - July 24 & 31, 2020"

After my previous Baskin visit, I still had money on my gift card. So I went back twice.

Everyone deserves a second chance, right?  And if that goes well, a third one, too?

Each time, I ate my scoop on a bench on the median of Houston Ave, watching the traffic thunder by.

### *What I Tasted:*
Tastes are currently not allowed due to COVID.

### *What I Ordered:*
Date Night is a rich, salty combination of chocolate and caramel ice cream. The two flavors swirl together, streaked with ribbons of caramel and punctuated by chocolate caramel cups. I love rich, salty chocolate flavors, and this was a dream. I liked it so much I ordered it both times.

The texture was variable. On my first visit, it was perfect:  smooth, firm, and a little soft. My second helping was too hard. Still, both were decent scoops of ice cream, and neither contained any ice.

### *The Shop*
Okay, so Baskin Robbins can do better than it did on my first visit. Still, the ice cream was inconsistent. And a scoop there is only marginally cheaper than (superior) locally-owned shops. So while I may drop in the next time that I have a gift card or options are limited, my heart remains with the little guys.
