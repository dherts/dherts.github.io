title: "Van Leeuwen - July 19, 2020"
---
I went to Van Leeuwen once before. It was okay that time. I was put off by the number of locations and frankly, because they carry vegan ice cream. (What can I say?  I'm a purist.)  Still, I wanted to try something new. I can't remember what I got--maybe some type of caramel--but it underwhelmed me.

But I went back today with some friends. And boy, am I glad that I did.

### *What I Tasted:*
Tastes are currently not allowed due to COVID.

### *What I Ordered:*
A stranger remarked that currants and cream tasted "like cheesecake."  He was right. The (sour) cream base was terrific:  tangy, salty, and sweet. It was a stellar canvas for the stripes of fruity red currant jam that streaked each scoop. Together, they tasted like frozen fruit cheesecake.

"But what about the texture, Dylan?" Well, dear readers, it was perfect--rich and smooth. My scoop started to melt as soon as I stepped back outside into the 90-degree afternoon. But it survived a trip halfway down the block to a park where we sat down to eat. Basically, it was the ideal texture (outside of New England), just like [Sundaes & Cones](http://dylan.herts.io/2020/06/25/sundaes.html).

### *The Shop*
Van Leeuwen is expensive. It was $5.75 for one scoop and a staggering $7.75 for two. (Although I should add that I generally believe that smaller scoops are better. That's a discussion for another time, however.)  That's a lot for a brand with so many locations and that distributes its ice cream in grocery stores. Still, if it's this great every time, then I can see why people buy it.

Van Leeuwen hasn't jumped to the very top of my list, but now I'd say it's one of the better options in NYC. And at the very least, it made a drastic comeback from my previous visit. Now the question is whether it'll stand up to a third go-round.
