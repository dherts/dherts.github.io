title: "Mitchell's - September 22, 2020"

It was a dry, sunny afternoon in my hometown of Beachwood, OH. I was home visiting my parents while funemployed. My favorite local chain, Mitchell's, recently opened a shop within walking distance. So I went.

### *What I Tasted*
Guess what? Still no samples.

### *What I Ordered*
Coffee chocolate chunk is wonderful. It's been my favorite coffee flavor for years. This time was no different. The base was bold coffee, strong but not bitter. The texture was excellent; smooth and a bit stretchy, albeit softer and faster to melt than a New England scoop. And as always, the chocolate chunks did not disappoint. They're ribbons, really; ripples of dark chocolate that vary in thickness and length. Typically, at least one is gigantic--a rich, chewy prize buried somewhere in the cup.

### *The Shop*
Mitchell's makes stellar ice cream. Their flavors are traditional but varied. Admittedly, I haven't tried many because I always order coffee chocolate chunk. But the other ones sound great, and my parents like many of them. Plus, Mitchell's sizes are reasonably proportioned and well-priced. And they offer "Taster's" combinations that make it easy to try more flavors without having to order a larger size than you want. There are other great ice cream shops in Cleveland (East Coast Custard, for one, despite its name), but Mitchell's is my favorite.
