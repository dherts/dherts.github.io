On a sunny, sticky Sunday afternoon, I went for a walk with some family.  We stopped in at this West Village scoop shop for a cold treat.  

What we got was a mystery.  Was it ice cream or gelato?  Signs in the shop proclaimed it "Artisanal Ice Cream."  But the freezer contents had the the glossy, dense look of gelato.  Some of the choices, like mascarpone, seemed like gelato flavors.  And like any gelato shop, there was also sorbet on offer. 

Whatever it was, it was good.

### *What I Tasted:*
Tastes are currently not allowed due to COVID.

### *What I Ordered:*
Coffee Mocha Choco Chip is a redundant but accurate name.  The coffee base was creamy; more like a milky latte than a bitter espresso.  Flakes of dark chocolate punctuated the creamy base.  They were good, but I would've expected (and hoped) they'd be larger.

The texture further suggested gelato.  It was dense and elastic, and it melted a bit faster than ice cream would.  Still, it was good by any metric.

### *The Shop*
Cones feels like it's been there awhile.  It lacked the luster of a newer shop.  I can see why it's survived; it's a solid scoop.

I'd go back here if I was in the neighborhood.  Like I said, it's pretty good--whatever it is.  But if I had time, I'd venture a little further to one of my favorites--either il laboratorio (for gelato) or Sundaes and Cones (for ice cream).
