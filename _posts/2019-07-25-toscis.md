An errand tore me away from my bar studies. Afterwards, my walk home took me under sunny skies and past Toscanini’s, so how could I resist?

### What I Tasted
Cajeta (goat milk caramel); Chocolate Black Pepper Bourbon

### What I Ordered  
Chocolate Black Pepper Bourbon is named by order of appearance.

First, the chocolate–moderately dark, maybe around 55%. It’s dark enough to announce itself, but still a little sweet. Next, the black pepper. It’s light but it’s there: a tickle at the back of the throat, a crackle on the tongue. Finally, there’s barely a flash of bourbon syrup at the end. Together, the flavor is a nice rich-chocolate variation, and the chocolate/pepper combo will likely appeal to those who like spicy-chocolate flavors, *see, e.g.*, Jeni’s Queen City Cayenne. As for the bourbon: I say turn it up or take it out.

As I would expect of Tosci’s, the texture was nearly perfect: thick enough to bend a plastic spoon. I say nearly because there was one tiny streak of ice.

### The Shop
This scoop is a great example of what makes Toscanini my favorite in Boston: high-quality ice cream in an inventive, well-executed flavor.
