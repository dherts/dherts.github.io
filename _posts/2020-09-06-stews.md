My brother and I returned to the goliath of grocery stores, the , and the  of soft serve ice cream: Stew Leonard's

### *What I Tasted*
Sweet, delicious joy. But no samples.

### *What I Ordered*
Chocolate and vanilla swirl is the classic. Soft serve flavor choice can be controversial. My brother swears by vanilla. He makes a (rather persuasive) argument that chocolate soft serve barely tastes like chocolate. And rather than put up with its ersatz attempt, he says, you should just commit to the creaminess of the vanilla. He may be right. But in any case, the stakes are low. Because, as I have argued previously, flavor barely matters when it comes to soft serve.
