title: "Sundaes & Cones - August 27, 2020"
---
I'd raved about Sundaes & Cones a lot. My wife eventually got curious, and we both went for a late-afternoon scoop.

### *What I Tasted:*
My wife ordered mint chocolate chip and let me steal a spoonful. The mint base was fresh, clean, and light. The texture was smooth and rich. The chocolate chunks could've been a little darker and larger. But overall, we both thought it was excellent.

### *What I Ordered:*
Black sesame is one of my favorite flavors. This one was no exception. Creamy and flecked with broken black sesame seeds, it was equal parts sweet and umami. And as always, Sundaes & Cones delivered on the texture--smooth, tough, and ice-free. Previously, my favorite single flavor (as opposed to my favorite overall shop) in New York City was the black sesame at Chinatown Ice Cream Factory. But this flavor gave that one a serious run for its money.

### *The Shop*
There isn't much to say here. This place remains my favorite scoop shop in New York City. And now, one more fan has joined its ranks.
