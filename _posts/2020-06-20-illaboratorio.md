title: "Il Laboratorio - June 20, 2020"
---
The last few months have been strange, to say the least. But it's gotten warmer, I've moved to New York City, and on a warm summer afternoon,  I strolled down through the East Village with some old friends to visit Il Laboratorio.

### *What I Tasted:*
As a precaution, they didn't allow tastes.

### *What I Ordered:*
Thai chili chocolate was excellent:  rich, dark, and with flashes of heat. I especially liked the amount of spice. I've had spicy chocolate flavors that were too hot (*see, e.g.*, Il Massimo), but this one was enough to enhance the chocolate without overwhelming it. And most importantly, the texture was smooth and creamy. I saw a few flakes of ice, but I never tasted them.

Black sesame wasn't as good. The chunks of seeds were rather large, which threw off the smoothness of the gelato. And curiously, their flavor wasn't actually that strong. Instead, it tasted mostly of plain, creamy sweetness (basically fior di latte). That paled in comparison to the mouth-watering umami of the black sesame ice cream factory at Chinatown Ice Cream Factory. I wonder if that's because the higher fat content of ice cream (as opposed to gelato) carries the black sesame flavor better. In any case, I wouldn't order this flavor again.

### *The Shop*
Il Laboratorio is my favorite gelato shop in New York. They consistently nail the texture and they constantly experiment with flavor. I like some of those flavors more than others. But every time I walk in, I find at least one that I know I'll love and another to take a chance on. I never regret a visit.
