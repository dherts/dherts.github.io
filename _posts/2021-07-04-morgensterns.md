title: "Morgenstern's - July 4, 2021"

This post is overdue, and is a compilation of several ice cream visits over the past few months. In short, I have found my new favorite scoop shop in New York. And while it is outrageously expensive, it is worth every penny, rivaling even the famous Toscanini's of Cambridge.

### *What I Tasted:*
The pandemic may be subsiding, but tastes have not returned. Whether they ever will remains to be seen.

### *What I Ordered:*
So far, I have made four visits to Morgenstern's, enough to test out my initial, wildly positive impression. And let me say, every time they've nailed that one, most critical aspect, which is--say it with me--the consistency. Each scoop has been thick enough to stick a spoon in, yet soft enough to stick to the spoon when you take it out, hard enough to stand up to summer heat, but soft enough to melt in your mouth. That, plus the quality and creativity of the flavor combinations, were enough to vault Morgenstern's up towards the top of my list. But then it solidly cemented the lead by demonstrating the sheer depth of flavors they have to offer, most of which have been amazing--the likes of which I have not seen since Toscanini's. Here is my power ranking of what I've tried so far.

1. **Macadamia Praline Banana** was stellar. A sweet, creamy banana base, with chunks of real banana discernible as the cream melted away, and stripped salty, crunchy stripes of what seemed to be macadamia praline butter. It was the lux  version of the classic peanut-butter-and-banana combo, which I love deeply.

2. **Mascarpone Salted Hazelnut** was another study in contrasts. The salty, tangy mascarpone base might have been overpowering on its own, but a core of rich, sweet toasted hazelnuts evened things out perfectly.

3. **Pistachio Black Currant Jelly** probably could have won my heart over just with the traditional pistachio base. But then it added in stripes of sweet, dark currant jelly--a perfect offset to the nutty creaminess of the pistachio.

4. **Bourbon Vanilla** was fine. What do you want, it's vanilla!? It was pretty decent. But aside from an identifiable streak of bourbon in the base, there was not too much to get excited about. Still, it was the perfect scoop for the occasion: a hot summer afternoon in early June, with the line curled around the block up LaGuardia Place.

### *The Shop*
Morgenstern's is not cheap. A scoop, with tax, regularly costs over $6. And the old-time soda counter decor and cutting-edge web presence makes me wonder if too many of those dollars go towards branding, rather than the product itself. But what's there to complain about? The product is amazing, definitely my favorite in New York and perhaps one for all-time.
