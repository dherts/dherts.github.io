You’ve reached the personal website of Dylan Herts.

I am an attorney. I’m interested in antitrust law, complex litigation, and computers. In my free time, I like to run, hike, listen to jazz, and eat ice cream.

I occasionally write blog posts on this site, mostly about ice cream.  All opinions expressed on this site are mine and mine alone. Nothing on this site is legal advice.
