You’ve reached the personal website of Dylan Herts.

I'm a lawyer.  I’m interested in antitrust law, complex litigation, and computers.  In my free time, I like to run, hike, listen to jazz, and eat ice cream.

I occasionally write blog posts here, mostly about ice cream.   All opinions expressed in them are mine and mine alone.  Nothing here is legal advice.
